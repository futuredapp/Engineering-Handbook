# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

ADRs are a recommended documentation method for our projects
â€“ besides keeping the [README](READMEs.md) up-to-date
and documenting all the not obvious code inline.

## When to write ADRs

If the project is expected to be maintained and not thrown away
it is a great idea to document important decisions.

When project uses new architecture, dependencies or new technologies
there is no doubt ADRs are a great solution
to improve the sustainability and handover of the project.

They should improve our team knowledge all over our projects.
They make decisions transparent for developers
who will be exploring and working with the repository in the future.
