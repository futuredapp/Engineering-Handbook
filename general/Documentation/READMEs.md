# READMEs

Every repository we make must have a README file.
It should be up-to-date so every team member
can check the most important information about the project
in a fast and efficient manner.

We've made templates for our most used platforms
so we can quickly fill new README files:

- [iOS](https://github.com/futuredapp/iOS-project-template/blob/main/README.md)
- [Android](https://github.com/futuredapp/android-project-template/blob/master/README.md)
