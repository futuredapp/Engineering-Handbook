# Security guidelines

All our projects should adhere to some of the [Futured security standards](https://www.notion.so/futured/Z-sady-bezpe-nosti-907955f697dd4e2484448a087561550a). The rules for the standards are based on the [MASVS](https://mobile-security.gitbook.io/masvs/) rules and are customized to our needs. You can read the list of the rules [here](https://www.notion.so/futured/Bezpe-nostn-Futured-standard-vych-dzaj-ci-z-OWASP-MASVS-2b6796649008466eb114ecb8e310d5e2).

The selected standard should be clearly stated for the project in the README of the project and also in the Notion of the project. In case that some rules from the standard are customized, added, or removed then the Notion page should list these changes.
