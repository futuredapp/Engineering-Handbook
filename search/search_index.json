If a user cannot understand and operate your app with VoiceOver, it is not accessible.</p> <p>Good VoiceOver support is built on a few core principles.</p> <p>The Golden Rules of VoiceOver</p> <p>Every interactive element MUST be accessible. VoiceOver users can only interact with what the accessibility system can see. Buttons, sliders, toggles, and all other controls must be exposed to VoiceOver.</p> <p>Every element needs a clear label. If an element doesn't have a visible text title, you must provide a concise accessibilityLabel. VoiceOver should announce what the element is (e.g., \"Add to cart,\" \"User profile,\" \"Settings\").</p> <p>The navigation order must be logical. The order in which VoiceOver moves through elements (by swiping left or right) should follow the visual flow of the screen. In SwiftUI, this is usually handled automatically, but you must verify it for complex layouts.</p> <p>Group related information. Elements that form a single piece of information should be grouped. For example, a label \"Name\" and the value \"John Appleseed\" should be read together as one item, not two separate ones.</p> <p>Core Modifiers for VoiceOver Support</p> <p>SwiftUI provides a powerful set of view modifiers to implement the rules above.</p> Labels: What is this? (.accessibilityLabel) <p>Use this for elements without visible text, like icon-only buttons. The label should be short and descriptive. It should not include the element's type (e.g., use \"Settings,\" not \"Settings button\").</p> <pre><code>Button(action: { /* ... */ }) {\n    Image(systemName: \"gear\")\n}\n.accessibilityLabel(\"Settings\")\n</code></pre> Traits: What kind of element is this? (.accessibilityAddTraits) <p>Traits add context by telling VoiceOver the element's role. This is crucial for custom components. For standard components like <code>Button</code> or <code>Toggle</code>, traits are often added automatically.</p> <ul> <li><code>.isButton</code>: The element acts as a button.</li> <li><code>.isHeader</code>: The element is a section header.</li> <li><code>.isSelected</code>: The element is currently selected (e.g., a tab).</li> <li><code>.isLink</code>: The element opens a URL.</li> </ul> <pre><code>Text(\"Personal Information\")\n    .font(.headline)\n    .accessibilityAddTraits(.isHeader)\n</code></pre> Values: What is its current state? (.accessibilityValue) <p>Use this to communicate the current value of a control that can change, like a slider, toggle, or text field.</p> <pre><code>Slider(value: $volume, in: 0...100)\n    .accessibilityValue(\"\\(Int(volume)) percent\")\n\nToggle(\"Wi-Fi\", isOn: $isWifiEnabled)\n    // No explicit value needed. VoiceOver reads the state\n    // from the Toggle itself (\"On\" or \"Off\").\n</code></pre> Hints: What will happen? (.accessibilityHint) <p>A hint provides extra information about the result of an action. Use them sparingly, only when the action's result isn't obvious from the label. VoiceOver reads the hint after a short pause.</p> <pre><code>Button(\"Clear History\") { /* ... */ }\n    .accessibilityHint(\"This action cannot be undone.\")\n</code></pre> Combining &amp; Hiding Elements <ul> <li>Combining: Use <code>.accessibilityElement(children: .combine)</code> to group multiple views into a single VoiceOver element.
