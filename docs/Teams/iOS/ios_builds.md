# Build distribution

There are three build configurations.
    
## Debug builds

Debug builds are created in Xcode by developers. See project readme to find how you can create a debug build.

## Beta builds

Beta builds are mainly used by our QA team. There's possibility to add beta build to external testing and share it via link or email invitation if needed (see attached screenshot). External beta build has to go through app review. It can take longer for the first build or after some longer period without uploading a new build but it's usually approved immediately. Always send tested builds to external testing!

Although it is possible to invite external users to Futured's App Store Connect and add them to internal testing we prefer external testing for the following reasons:

- internal builds are automatically submited with merged pull request =>Â these builds should be tested first which cannot be guaranteed in internal testing
- security concerns

## Production builds

Production builds can be either distributed via Futured's or customer's App Store Connect account. It is also possible to set up ASC account later and migrate the app (see [docs](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/transfer-an-app/overview-of-app-transfer/)) but we strongly recommend to make a decesion before releasing the first version.
