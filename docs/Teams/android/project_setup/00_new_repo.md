# First steps

## Creating repository
Create new repository by using one of project templates, depending on the project type:

- [futuredapp/kmp-futured-template](https://github.com/futuredapp/kmp-futured-template) for Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) projects
- [futuredapp/android-project-template-compose](https://github.com/futuredapp/android-project-template-compose) for Android-only projects

### Repository naming
When creating a new repository, follow the naming convention:

- KMP: `<project-name>-kmp`
- Android-only: `<project-name>-android`

## Project Setup

### KMP

Follow instructions in repository, which include running init script which will set up application ID, package naming and other things.

### Android-only
