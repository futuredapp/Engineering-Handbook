We use GitHub for code collaboration and follow best practices to ensure our pull requests are easy to review, maintain high quality, and integrate smoothly into our workflow.

- **Keep PRs Small and Focused**  
  Submit pull requests that address a single purpose or issue. Smaller, focused PRs are easier and faster to review and reduce the risk of introducing bugs.

- **Informative Titles and Descriptions**  
  Use clear, descriptive titles. In the description, provide context on what the PR does, reference the related Jira ticket, and include any relevant details or links. This helps reviewers quickly understand the change and its purpose.

- **Include Jira Ticket Numbers**  
  Reference the relevant Jira ticket number in the PR title and description to link code changes to tracked work. When it is properly linked, the PR will automatically update the ticket status in Jira.

- **Review Before Submitting**  
  Test and review your own changes before opening a PR. This helps catch errors early and improves the quality of the review process.

- **English, Czech and Slovak Only**  
  All PR titles, descriptions, and comments must be written in these languages to ensure clarity for all collaborators.

- **Leverage Automation**  
  We use tools like Copilot and CodeRabbit to assist with PR summaries, code suggestions, and automated code analysis. These tools provide early feedback and help maintain consistent code quality.

- **Slack Integration**  
  PR activity on some projects is integrated with Slack to keep the team informed of new pull requests, reviews, and merges in real time. There are dedicated channels for each project to facilitate communication and collaboration.

- **Feature and Bugfix Branches**  
  Open pull requests from feature (`feature/…`) and bugfix (`bugfix/…`) branches with the base branch set to `develop`.
- **Hotfix Branches**  
  Open pull requests from hotfix (`hotfix/…`) branches with the base branch set to `main`.

- **Who to Assign**  
  Assign your pull request to at least one teammate who is familiar with the relevant codebase or feature area. If unsure, consult your team lead or refer to the code ownership guidelines.

- **When to Assign**  
  Assign reviewers immediately after opening the pull request. This ensures timely feedback and helps keep the development process moving smoothly. 

- **Sync Regularly**  
  Regularly update your branch with the latest changes from the base branch (`develop` or `main`) to minimize merge conflicts and ensure your code is tested against the most recent version.

By following these guidelines, we ensure our pull requests are clear, actionable, and easy to review, leading to faster merges and higher code quality.
