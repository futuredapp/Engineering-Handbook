**Backend**  
The server-side part of an application responsible for business logic, database interactions, and server configuration.

**Caching**  
The process of storing frequently accessed data in memory to improve performance and reduce database load (e.g., using Redis or Memcached).

**CI (Continuous Integration)**  
A practice where code changes are automatically built and tested to detect issues early in the development cycle.

**CD (Continuous Deployment/Delivery)**  
Automated processes for deploying code to production or staging environments after passing automated tests.

**CMS (Content Management System)**  
Software that allows users to create, manage, and modify website content without needing to code.

**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**  
A language used to describe the presentation and layout of web pages.

**CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)**  
The four basic operations for managing data in a database or application.

**DevOps**  
A set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the development lifecycle and deliver high-quality software.

**Docker**  
A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers, which are lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient units of software.

**ES6 (ECMAScript 6)**  
A major update to JavaScript that introduced new syntax and features, making the language more powerful and easier to work with.

**DOM (Document Object Model)**  
A programming interface that represents the structure of HTML or XML documents as a tree of objects, allowing scripts to update content, structure, and style.

**Frontend**  
The client-side part of an application that users interact with directly, typically built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**Full Stack**  
Refers to development across both frontend and backend, encompassing all layers of an application or website.

**GraphQL**  
An open-source query language and runtime for APIs that enables clients to request exactly the data they need. It reduces over-fetching and under-fetching of data and allows for more efficient, flexible queries.

**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**  
The standard language for creating web pages and web applications.

**HTTP/HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol / Secure)**  
Protocols for transferring data over the web; HTTPS adds encryption for security.

**IDE (Integrated Development Environment)**  
Software that provides comprehensive tools for software development, such as code editing, debugging, and testing.

**JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**  
A lightweight data-interchange format, easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate.

**JS (JavaScript)**  
A programming language used to create dynamic and interactive effects within web browsers.

**JWT (JSON Web Token)**  
A compact, URL-safe token format used for securely transmitting information between parties, commonly used for authentication and authorization.

**Load Balancer**  
A system that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure reliability and scalability.

**Middleware**  
Software that acts as a bridge between different systems or layers, commonly used in web frameworks to process requests and responses.

**NoSQL**  
A category of database systems that store and retrieve data in formats other than relational tables, such as key-value, document, columnar, or graph formats. Popular NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis.

**ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)**  
A programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems in object-oriented programming languages. It allows developers to interact with a database using objects instead of SQL queries.

**PWA (Progressive Web Application)**  
A type of web app that uses modern web capabilities to deliver an app-like experience to users.

**Rate Limiting**  
A technique used to control the number of requests a user or service can make to an API within a given time frame.

**REST (Representational State Transfer)**  
An architectural style for designing networked applications, commonly used for building APIs.

**SaaS (Software as a Service)**  
A software distribution model in which applications are hosted by a provider and made available to customers over the internet.

**SPA (Single Page Application)**  
A web application that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates content as the user interacts with the app.

**SQL (Structured Query Language)**  
A standard language for managing and manipulating relational databases.

**TypeScript**  
A strongly-typed superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, interfaces, and other features to improve code quality and maintainability, commonly used in both frontend and backend (Node.js) development.


**UI (User Interface)**  
The visual elements of an application that users interact with.

**UX (User Experience)**  
The overall experience a user has when interacting with a product or service, focusing on ease of use and satisfaction.

**Version Control**  
A system (like Git) for tracking changes to code, enabling collaboration and history tracking.

**WebSocket**  
A protocol for full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection, commonly used in real-time web applications.
