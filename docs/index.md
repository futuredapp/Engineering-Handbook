## Welcome ðŸ‘‹

This Engineering Handbook serves as the central knowledge repository for Futured's engineering practices, standards, and workflows. It's designed to help both new and existing team members understand how we work and maintain consistency across our projects.

We believe in open collaboration and sharing knowledge. By making our engineering handbook public, we demonstrate our commitment to quality, transparency, and continuous improvement in everything we build.
